## Overview
This document outlines the major bugs that were discovered and resolved in the Lead Capture Form integration with Supabase.

---

## Critical Fixes Implemented

### 1. Lead Data Not Saving to Supabase
**File**: `LeadCaptureForm.tsx`
**Severity**: High
**Status**: Fixed

#### Problem
Form submissions were not persisting lead data to the Supabase database. As a result, leads were not recorded, affecting marketing and follow-up workflows.

#### Root Cause
The insertion logic for the `leads` table was missing or incorrectly configured.

#### Fix
Added logic to validate form inputs and insert lead data (name, email, industry, session_id, submitted_at) into Supabase’s `leads` table.

```ts
await supabase.from('leads').insert([{
  formData.name,
  formData.email,
  formData.industry,
  formData.session_id
}]);
```

### 2. Removed Duplicate Confirmation Email Call
**File**: `LeadCaptureForm.tsx`
**Severity**: Medium
**Status**: Fixed

#### Problem
Users were receiving two confirmation emails per form submission.

#### Root Cause
The Edge Function send-confirmation was being called twice due to duplicate function triggers.

#### Fix
Removed the redundant call and ensured send-confirmation is triggered only after successful database insertion.

#### 3.Crash in Edge Function: Cannot Read Properties of Undefined
**File**: `supabase/functions/send-confirmation/index.ts`
**Severity**: High
**Status**: Fixed

#### Problem
The Edge Function crashed with Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '1').

#### Root Cause
The Edge Function send-confirmation was being called twice due to duplicate function triggers.The code was incorrectly trying to access data.choices[1] when only one choice was returned from the API.

#### Fix
Corrected code to access `data.choices[0].message?.content` to safely get the first choice's content.

```ts
const content = data.choices[0].message?.content;
```

#### 4.Implemented Session ID Tracking in Leads Form
**File**: `LeadCaptureForm.tsx`
**Severity**: Medium
**Status**: Fixed

#### Problem
No session tracking for leads; the count of leads submitted during the current session was inaccurate or unavailable.

#### Root Cause
Session ID was not generated or persisted; leads were not queried by session.

#### Fix
- Generate a UUID session ID on form mount and persist it in localStorage.
- Include session_id in lead data inserted into the database.
- After each successful submission, query Supabase for all leads with the current session ID and update local state.
- Display a dynamic message showing the actual count of leads submitted during the current session, e.g., “You’re #3 in this session.”
- Removed localStorage usage from client.ts to avoid conflicts.

### Supabase Setup

### Impact
- Accurate tracking of session-specific lead submissions
- Better user feedback on lead queue position in current session
- Persistent session data across page reloads

Ensure your Supabase project includes a `leads` table with the following columns:

| Column        | Type                     |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| `id`          | UUID or serial PRIMARY KEY |
| `name`        | text                     |
| `email`       | text                     |
| `industry`    | text                     |
| `session_id`  | text                     |
| `submitted_at`| timestamp                |

### Notes

- All errors during saving or email sending are logged to the browser console.
- You can update the table name or field structure in `LeadCaptureForm.tsx` as needed.
- The confirmation email is sent via a Supabase Edge Function named `send-confirmation`.
